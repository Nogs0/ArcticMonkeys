					Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino is the sixth studio album by English rock band Arctic Monkeys, released
					on 11 May 2018 by Domino Recording Company. It was written by band frontman Alex Turner in 2016 on a
					Steinway Vertegrand piano in his Los Angeles home. It was produced in Los Angeles, Paris and London by
					frequent Arctic Monkeys collaborator James Ford and Turner, alongside a wide array of guest musicians
					including Tom Rowley, Loren Humphrey, James Righton, Zach Dawes, Tyler Parkford and Cam Avery. Turner
					designed the album artwork himself, which depicts the resort with cardboard cut-outs and a tape
					recorder. Its title refers to Tranquility Base, the site of the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing.
